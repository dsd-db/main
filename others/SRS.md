#### Basic Flow

| Actor | System |
| ----- | ------ |
| The end user selects the "Change" option | |
| The end user input the original password and the new word twice | |
| The end user clicks the "yes" button | |
| The interaction check whether the two new password is the same | |
| | User ID, original password and  new password are transported to the database by the server |
| | Find the User ID, and check  wheter the original password is correct |
| | Change the password in the database |
| Interaction dispalys a feedback for successful change | |
